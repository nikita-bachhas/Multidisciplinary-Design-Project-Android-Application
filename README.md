# Multidisciplinary-Design-Project-Android-Application
The android application allows for bluetooth connection to the robot, control the movement of the robot and tracks the location of the obstacles and the live location of the robot.

## Functionality
1. The android application connects to the Raspberry Pi (RPI) module through bluetooth, which in turn facilitates the connection between the application and the robot. 
2. The android application controls the movement of the robot, allowing it to move forward, backward, right and left. 
3. The android application displays a virtual arena that allows for marking of 10x10 obstacles and also displays the live location of the robot as it is moving in the arena.
